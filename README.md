# python-api-challenge
Within the WeatherPy folder of the repo there are two additional files.
The first Python script named WeatherPy was used to visualize over 500 different cities of varying distances in order to make a representative model of the weather across the cities.
The openWeatherMap API was used to retrieve weather data from the cities list.
Afterwards plots were created to show the relationship between different weather variables and latitude and then computed the linear regression for each relationship.

The second file name VacationPy contains a python script I had trouble making a proper api call on.
I tried using different code from previous activities to generate the neccessary lists, but would definetely benefit from more experienced input about would I could have done differently.
As shown the in the file I wasn't able to find any hotel for the selected cities and coordinates.
